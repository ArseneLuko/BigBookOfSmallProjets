# Excercasing Python with The Big Book of Small Python Projects
The book by Al Sweigart offers around 100 python scripts (usualy simple games). I use this to learn and improve my python skills. 

## How the learning works
I folow simple rules:

1. Download the program and run it to see what the program does for yourself.
2. Starting from a blank file, copy the code of the game from this book by manually typing it yourself. (Don’t use copy and paste!)
3. Run the program again, and go back and fix any typos or bugs you may have introduced.
4. Run the program under a debugger, so you can carefully execute each line of code one at a time to understand what it does.
5. Find the comments marked with (!) to find code that you can modify and then see how this affects the program the next time you run it.
6. Finally, try to re-create the program yourself from scratch. It doesn’t have to be an exact copy; you can put your own spin on the program.

## Files in the repository
Each script is named as same as original script by Al Sweigart, after name there is added `_transcription` – means simpy transcipted from original line by line or `_mine` which indicates my solution writen from scratch.
